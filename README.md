# Pairrit

Welcome! Are you working with a high-performing team, using Slack for
communication, and find yourself wondering things like:

* Who is pairing right now?
* What's everyone working on?
* Is anyone looking for a pair?

If you need a simple solution for transparency into what your team members
are working on, and in what configuration, consider using Pairrit to easily
view and update the status of pairs and other working groups within your team.

### Concepts:

* Start, join, leave, and list pairs
* A pair is two or more people
* A pair is ephemeral
* A pair begins when the first person joins
* A pair ends when the last person leaves

## Available Commands:

`/pair help`  - list available commands and how to use them
`/pair join`  - join or start a pair
`/pair leave` - depart from your current pair
`/pair list`  - show all pairs in progress, and who is particpating

### Contributing:

1. Clone the repository
1. Checkout a feature branch
1. Implement your feature
1. Commit your changes and push
1. Create a pull request for your feature branch

Someone will code review your change, and merge if it is approved.

## History

This project is the result of conversations between Michael Schoonmaker,
Jonmichael Chambers, Alexander Deschamps, and Cory Flanigan--the original
contributors--regarding how to create visibility into the work being done
by self-organizing teams.

## Thanks

Special thanks to these kind folks, and everyone who contributes time and feedback in testing, pairing, discussing, and inspiring!
