Per @mschoonmaker, we'd like more transparency into what our team members are working on, and in what configurations (pairs, triples, and mobs).

Pairrot provides a set of commands in Slack to easily check and update status of groups and work in progress:

* View a list of pairs/groups and their current focus (eg Story Card, Issue Number, etc.)
* Start, join, and leave groups, a group is ephemeral and begins when the first person joins and ends when the last person leaves

Provides clear insight into the number of developers in a pair or mob, by representing the group as a parrot wave.

Initial implementation of 
/pair list - show all pairs in the same grouping
/pair join - join the pair

/pair start [optional-story-number]
